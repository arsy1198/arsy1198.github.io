```

We often make plots in data science

Here's the tidyverse.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe

```{r}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
)
```

Here's a plot

```{r}
plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
